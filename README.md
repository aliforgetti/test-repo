# Github Flow Demonstration
Repo to demonstrate github flow. 

1. Initialize a repository
2. **Clone** the repository
3. Create a **branch**
4. Make edits (**Staging**) to the repository
5. **Commit** your changes - preferably in a logical chronological manner so it makes sense. Better to have these in smaller chunks of changes. 
6. To add your changes to the **master**, you do a three part process:
  - **Pull**
  - **Merge** - Merge any changes that have happened in the **Master** branch while you were making the changes. 
  - **Push**
